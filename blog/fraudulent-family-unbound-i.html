As of such, its format is a bit different from other tales. This is the first in a series of two stories, the second being "Serene Seclusion."</p><p style="text-align: center;">____________________________________________</p><p id="isPasted">Characters by Order of Appearance</p><ul><li>Isolde- Part of the Unbound Unanimity Group, paid by Alder to act as a mother to his son. While around Amadour, she uses the name Yseut. For the most part, she acts strictly professional, but slowly becomes somewhat attached to Amadour over time.</li><li>Clarice- Works at the Unbound Unanimity Group, very professional and respectful. Not very present in the story.</li><li>Alder- Father of Amadour. Wants what is best for his son but greatly upset by the death of his wife years before, and as a result is somewhat emotionally unstable.</li><li>Amadour- Son of Alder, and one year old at the beginning of the play. He believes that Isolde is his mother and looks up to both of his parents. Bold and excited.</li><li>Euell- Husband of Isolde. Very supportive of Isolde’s actions and choices.</li></ul><p style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: center;">____________________________________________</p><blockquote><p style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: left;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Show begins with desk and two chairs. Isolde is talking to herself while sitting at the desk.</span></p></blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">ISOLDE</span></p><p>I’m not Isolde. I’m Yseut. I’m not Isolde. I’m Yseut. I’m not...</p><blockquote><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Clarice enters while Isolde is talking, and Clarice walks towards Isolde.</span></p></blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">CLARICE</span></p><p>Isolde, a new role has been assigned to you. It’s a long term request.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">ISOLDE</span></p><p>Just give me the paperwork. I’ll figure out how I’ll act around it.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">CLARICE</span></p><p>That’s the thing. He’s asked to see you in person, and from his request, that’s not a bad thing.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">ISOLDE</span></p><p>Alright, send him in.</p><blockquote><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Clarice exits. Shortly afterwards, Alder enters and takes a seat across from Isolde.</span></p></blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">ALDER</span></p><p>Hello, sorry for the intrusion... I’m Alder. Clarice told me to come to you, Isolde. Thanks for taking your time... what do you think of my request?</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">ISOLDE</span></p><p>Haven’t read it or heard of it. You wanted to talk with me, might as well find out through that.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">ALDER</span></p><p>Well... okay. I’m sorry if I get emotional but this is a large request. See... my wife passed away a year back. Does... does the ’43 Collapse sound familiar?</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">ISOLDE</span></p><p>&nbsp;Oh m... my... I’m sorry to hear that she was a victim of that tragedy.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">ALDER</span></p><p>Yeah, I know. Not something in anybody’s control. But, well... she left behind me and my son. He was only a couple weeks old at the time, and now he’s a full year... and that’s why I’ve come to you. My payment will be very generous for this because I’m hoping I can depend on you for decades.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">ISOLDE</span></p><p>And that request is...?</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">ALDER</span></p><p>I would like to pay you to act as the mother of my son. I know it’s a heavy one, but it’s what your Unbound Unanimity specializes in. People acting as friends or family... The idea worked so well in Japan....</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">ISOLDE</span></p><p>True, but I haven’t exactly done a decade long request. I’ve been in this business for only 4 years now. I... I think I can fulfill this request, but we need to discuss this further for exact details. On days like this, you don’t usually come across such a request...</p><blockquote><p>Scene changes to six years later. Alder and Amadour are together at their home.</p></blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">ALDER</span></p><p>Amadour, come here. We need to prepare for Yseut to come home.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">AMADOUR</span></p><p>Awww, okay... Why does Mom work so much? She’s not here as much as you are.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">ALDER</span></p><p>Yseut just has some very hard work to take care of. Her job is very hard. That’s why I’m here to take care of you all day.</p><blockquote><p>Isolde enters Alder’s home. Amadour runs to her.</p></blockquote><p style="margin-left:0in;"><span style="font-weight: 700;">AMADOUR</span></p><p>Mom! You’re back!</p><p style="margin-left:0in;"><span style="font-weight: 700;">ISOLDE</span></p><p>Yes, and I got a surprise for you! I got a movie for us to watch!</p><p style="margin-left:0in;"><span style="font-weight: 700;">AMADOUR</span></p><p>Is it Gnome Zone? I love Gnomian so much!</p><p style="margin-left:0in;"><span style="font-weight: 700;">ISOLDE</span></p><p>Of course, sweetie. You’re too smart!</p><p style="margin-left:0in;"><span style="font-weight: 700;">ALDER</span></p><p>Heya Isolde. Yseut. Yseut, sorry.</p><p style="margin-left:0in;"><span style="font-weight: 700;">AMADOUR</span></p><p>Who’s Isolde, dad?</p><p style="margin-left:0in;"><span style="font-weight: 700;">ALDER</span></p><p>Nobody, Amadour. Let’s just watch the movie.</p><blockquote><p>Isolde, Alder, and Amadour begin to watch a movie. Amadour falls asleep.</p></blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">ALDER</span></p><p>Isolde, I need to talk to you about something.</p><p style="margin-left:0in;"><span style="font-weight: 700;">ISOLDE</span></p><p>Alright, let’s let Amadour sleep here. Let’s go to the other room.</p><blockquote><p>Isolde and Alder leave to a different room.</p></blockquote><p style="margin-left:0in;"><span style="font-weight: 700;">ALDER</span></p><p>Listen... I need to ask you about something. If you haven’t heard already, the Seventh Article was approved by Russell and will be in effect next week.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">ISOLDE</span></p><p>Wait, the one that restricts leaving any building for two months?</p><p style="margin-left:0in;"><span style="font-weight: 700;">ALDER</span></p><p style="margin-left:0in;">That’s the one... and you need to decide what you’re going to do. I know you have a whole life outside of mine, and that all jobs are on hold for the segment of time, but... Is Amadour going to have two months with or without his... mother?</p><p style="margin-left:0in;"><span style="font-weight: 700;">ISOLDE</span></p><p>Alder, you said it yourself. Job suspension includes your request. I’m married and have more than just this one role. It wouldn’t be fair to my other clients, or even myself. It’s my life and choice.</p><p style="margin-left:0in;"><span style="font-weight: 700;">ALDER</span></p><p>And you, Isolde, chose to sell your life. Are you really sacrificing a seven-year old child for your own selfishness?</p><p style="margin-left:0in;"><span style="font-weight: 700;">ISOLDE</span></p><p>You’re overstepping. Your request, at the end of the day, is a request. Your contract ties me for only two hours a day, and five times a week, and I spend so much more extra time to make your son happy. If anybody is selfish, it is you. You need to see that I’m not your wife, and you’re my client.</p><blockquote><p>Amadour wakes and enters the room with Alder and Isolde while the Alder and Isolde are talking.</p></blockquote><p style="margin-left:0in;"><span style="font-weight: 700;">AMADOUR</span></p><p style="margin-left:0in;">Mom? Dad? What’s going on?</p><p style="margin-left:0in;"><span style="font-weight: 700;">ISOLDE</span></p><p>We’re just talking about my job. I’ll help you get to bed right now, alright?</p><p style="margin-left:0in;"><span style="font-weight: 700;">AMADOUR</span></p><p>Oh, okay.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">ALDER</span></p><p>Fine, fine. A week to decide... I’m going to sleep.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">ISOLDE</span></p><p>Go ahead. Amadour, let’s take you to your room.</p><blockquote><p>Everybody exits. A scene with just Euell and Isolde in chairs is shown. Isolde has a bag.</p></blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">EUELL</span></p><p>Hey, Issy, did you hear about the news? It looks like the war is so bad that everybody is required to stay indoors for two months. They’re going to drop off weekly rations at each building. Looks like we have more time together!</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">ISOLDE</span></p><p>Yeah... exciting...</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">EUELL</span></p><p>Is something wrong? You seem a bit down.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">ISOLDE</span></p><p>Well... okay. You know that one client I work with who has a kid? He wants me to stay with his son for the next two months. Whether he pays or not, that’s all time I’d be taking away from you, and our anniversary is even next month. But then if I don’t do it, then some kid who doesn’t even know that I’m not his mother will be left alone.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">EUELL</span></p><p>But do you care about this family? That’s such a heavy request.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">ISOLDE</span></p><p>Only the son. His father is kind of a jerk sometimes, but then again, he’s only got me and his son.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">EUELL</span></p><p>Wait, this is the guy who you’ve had as a client for six years, right? This guy may be paying a lot, but your work has been almost without any weeks off these past years. If you don’t want to go, then you shouldn’t. But if you want to, then I support your choice. We can always celebrate some other time. Still... I would miss you when you’re gone.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">ISOLDE</span></p><p>Yeah, well... I have a week to figure it out. Let’s... let’s play a board game. That’ll be fun.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">EUELL</span></p><p>Alright. I’m all for it.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">ISOLDE</span></p><p>Let me just get the game out of my bag.</p><blockquote><p>Isolde looks through her bag, and finds the copy of the Gnome Zone movie.</p></blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">ISOLDE</span></p><p>Oh. That’s... oh.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">EUELL</span></p><p>What did you find? Oh! The Gnome Zone Movie! I remember that show.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">ISOLDE</span></p><p>Yeah... it does bring joy to some people...</p><blockquote><p>Scene shifts to Alder and Amadour at their home watching a movie.</p></blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">AMADOUR</span></p><p>I love this movie so much, it’s so much fun!</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">ALDER</span></p><p>I’m sure Yseut does too. Just not enough...</p><blockquote><p>The door opens and Isolde enters.</p></blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">ISOLDE</span></p><p>Who wants to play the Gnome Zone board game?</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">AMADOUR</span></p><p>Mom? You’re home! Wait, board game?</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">ALDER</span></p><p>Isolde? You’re staying?</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">ISOLDE</span></p><p>I’ve got a board game version I picked up for you! And I’m going to be away from work for a couple months so I can spend more time with you. And I have a friend with me! Come in!</p><blockquote><p style="margin-left:0in;">Euell enters the house.</p></blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">EUELL</span></p><p>Hello! I’m Euell. I’m a friend of your mother. I’m glad to meet you!</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">AMADOUR</span></p><p>Oh, hi! And thanks Mom! Are you really staying home for so long?</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">ISOLDE</span></p><p>Two whole months. It’ll be plenty of fun!
