As of such, its format is a bit different from other tales. This is the second in a series of two stories, the first being "Fraudulent Family."&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;">____________________________________________</p><p id="isPasted">Characters by Order of Appearance</p><ul><li>Isolde- Part of the Unbound Unanimity Group. She acts very professional and changes her personality for each role, but when acting as herself she acts very calmly. Acts as a priestess for Ailith’s fake wedding.</li><li>Ailith- Paying the Unbound Unanimity Group to create a fake wedding to satisfy parents.</li><li>Brinley- Ailith’s mother who is obsessive with Ailith marrying somebody and settling down. She does not actually care for who Ailith marries and instead cares about when Ailith is married.</li><li>Osborn- Part of the Unbound Unanimity Group and acting as Ailith’s husband. Acts like he loves Ailith for his job.</li></ul><p style="text-align: center;">____________________________________________</p><blockquote><p>Show begins with Isolde and Ailith speaking to each other over a table in the center. Both are sitting in chairs. Brinley is offstage at Stage Right.</p></blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">ISOLDE</span></p><p>That’s the severity of the issue, huh...</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">AILITH</span></p><p>Yeah, she expects me to be married by the end of this year to somebody and celebrate it with a wedding. And I’m not looking for any romance right now, so this is my only option.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">ISOLDE</span></p><p>I understand but let me first repeat your request so that you can confirm before signing the contract. You will be hiring the Unbound Unanimity to create a fake wedding in the coming months with the intent on deceiving your mother. The groom will also be an actor, and you are willing to pay in full the... significant cost of this event.</p><p style="margin-left:0in;"><span style="font-weight: 700;">AILITH</span></p><p>That is correct. She’s just so obsessive with my social life... if I don’t do this, she’ll blame herself and it’ll be a bigger mess than it needs to be.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">ISOLDE</span></p><p>And if you do find somebody you love, and she realizes he or she is different from the fake groom?</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">AILITH</span></p><p>She doesn’t care who I marry or love but instead whether I am married. It’s bizarre, I know. And if I really need to, I can just hire the groom to reprise his role. If this service is focused on faking family relationships for years, I’m sure an event for a couple of hours will be executed well. It’s a rental family service, after all.</p><blockquote><p>Isolde points to a spot on a paper on the table where Ailith is supposed to sign her name.</p></blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">ISOLDE</span></p><p>Well then. Sign here, and we’ll begin discussing the scale of the wedding, time, plans, and just about everything else we need ready. Ailith, was it?</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">AILITH</span></p><p>Indeed. And your name is...?</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">ISOLDE</span></p><p>Ys... Isolde. Sorry. I almost said the name of one of my other roles. Glad to meet you. Now, whether real or not, we have a wedding to plan.</p><blockquote><p>Isolde leaves to Stage Left while Brinley enters the stage from Stage Right.</p></blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">BRINLEY</span></p><p>I’m glad you could make it to lunch, it’s been so long since we talked in person and it’s a nice occasion before the big day!</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">AILITH</span></p><p>Glad to see you’re happy, mom.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">BRINLEY</span></p><p>I mean, you’re finally getting married. It took you long enough... What took you so long? Don’t you care about having a family?</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">AILITH</span></p><p>I wanted to wait for something real. That’s all.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">BRINLEY</span></p><p>Isn’t it lonely? Ah, what’s the use, I’ll never understand everything you do. When can I meet the lucky one to become part of our family?</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">AILITH</span></p><p>When we’re at the altar it should be fine.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">BRINLEY</span></p><p>Fine by me, it’s just a few days! Sooooo fun and exciting! &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Brinley starts tearing up at the thought of being a grandmother. Ailith starts having a negative attitude with worries of how Brinley will act at the wedding.</p></blockquote><p>I’ll finally be a grandma. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">AILITH</span></p><p>Yeah, yeah... a few more days. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Brinley takes a deep breath and then starts talking normal again.</p></blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">BRINLEY</span></p><p>Now, darling, are a lot of your friends coming to the wedding?</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">AILITH</span></p><p>They’re going to be there, that’s for sure.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">BRINLEY</span></p><p>Glad to hear it won’t be empty chairs. That would be embarrassing!</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">AILITH</span></p><p>Sure would...</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">BRINLEY</span></p><p>Ailith, what’s the matter?</p><blockquote><p>Brinley walks over and pats the back of Ailith. Ailith, not wanting to hurt Brinley’s feelings, starts stuttering as she lies.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">AILITH</span></p><p>Uh... I’m... just thinking about... uh... Allyson! Yeah. I wish she could be at the wedding. Very much. Very... much.</p><blockquote><p>Brinley begins tearing up again at the thought of Allyson, and as she speaks, Ailith becomes somewhat emotional as well.</p></blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">BRINLEY</span></p><p>Allyson... I miss her as much as you do. Your sister didn’t deserve what happened to her or unborn son, but it was her time... it’s part of the reason I’m so proud of you and excited to hold your children when you have them. We’ll... have a full family again.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">AILITH</span></p><p>Yeah, I... I know. Let’s just... let’s just have our meal and then get you back to my home, okay? I’ll... get working on preparing for the wedding and it’ll be great, alright?</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">BRINLEY</span></p><p>Yeah... okay.</p><blockquote><p>Brinley leaves to Stage Left while Isolde and Osborn come enter from Stage Left. Isolde, Osborn, and Ailith talk to each other while standing up.</p></blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">ISOLDE</span></p><p>Alright, Ailith. This is who will act as your groom. As requested, his name will be Osborn.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">OSBORN</span></p><p>Pleasure to meet you.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">AILITH</span></p><p>Nice to meet you too.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">ISOLDE</span></p><p>Now, the wedding is in a couple of hours. I will act as the priestess for the wedding as planned, and Osborn will say the vows, and everything shall be great. Just remember, refrain from any discussion of Osborn with your mother, Brinley, unless it is what we have already discussed as Osborn’s personality and hobbies... you get the idea. It’s just what we had been planning from before. Now, go get dressed, get your mom over here, and let’s begin.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">AILITH</span></p><p>Alright. Wait, Isolde... do you mind me asking a question?</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">ISOLDE</span></p><p>What is it?</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">AILITH</span></p><p>Do you ever worry if somebody finds out that you’re not who you say you are? You do this job a lot, and it’s not exactly a type of job many would do.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">ISOLDE</span></p><p>Of course, it’s always a worry. That’s why the price is so high for the job. I must become who I’m acting. And today I’m acting as the one who will question you at the altar. Let’s go get ready.</p><blockquote><p>The wedding begins. Isolde walks to the center and Ailith stands at her left and Osborn stands at her right. Brinley enters and takes a seat in a chair so she can see the three.</p></blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">ISOLDE</span></p><p>Welcome all to this joyous occasion. We have gathered here, amid a devastating war, to celebrate the union of these two in a sacred bond. These beings who have found each other in harmony, have become one in this glorious time. Ailith and Osborn, the two shall establish their honorable decision to become bound as a duo. If any at all object to this event, please, voice your reasoning or we shall continue the tradition.</p><blockquote><p>Isolde waits a few seconds before resuming her speech.</p></blockquote><p>Osborn, Ailith, your spirits shall uphold each other through your struggles. And with a perfect union comes dedication and understanding.</p><blockquote><p>Isolde turns to Osborn.</p></blockquote><p>Osborn, do you accept this woman as your wife, and vow to take her hand in matrimony? To protect her from injury, to respect her and aid her, to not deceive nor harm, to commit no adultery, and to live by her until the end of your lives?</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">OSBORN</span></p><p>I shall.</p><blockquote><p>Isolde turns to Ailith.</p></blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">ISOLDE</span></p><p>Ailith, do you accept this man as your husband, and vow to take his hand in matrimony? To protect him from injury, to respect him and aid him, to not deceive nor harm, to commit no adultery, and to live by him until the end of your lives?</p><blockquote><p>Ailith glances between Osborn and Brinley before responding.</p></blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">AILITH</span></p><p>I... shall.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">ISOLDE</span></p><p>Then let us celebrate this momentous day! It is my honor to be here and coalesce the two in such symbolic harmony. If it pleases, the bride and the groom may share a warm embrace.</p><blockquote><p>Ailith and Osborn hug. Ailith, Osborn, and Isolde face the audience and gestures with her hands towards them. Isolde speaks very excitedly.</p></blockquote><p>May everybody clap in celebration of this occasion for the unity of the two!</p><p>Isolde and Brinley clap while facing Ailith and Osborn. If the audience joins clapping, wait until they finish before continuing to speak.</p><p>Now, be merry and content! We have finished the vows and may now rejoice in our happiness!</p><p>Isolde and Obsorn walk slightly to Stage Left on the side and speak to each other silently while Ailith and Brinley speak towards Stage Right together. Brinley is very excited and happy, and Ailith is in a somewhat negative mood.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">BRINLEY</span></p><p>I’m so proud of my baby girl! I’m so glad you’ve finally pulled through after all my nagging. You’ve really grown up. Allyson would be so happy to see you. I’m... I’m just so happy after all of this!</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">AILITH</span></p><p>Yeah... me too. It’s... it’s a life changing experience. It’s... a happy day and wonderful day.</p><p><br></p></div><!--/blog_post_content-->
